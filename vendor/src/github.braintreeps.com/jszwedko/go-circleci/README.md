## go-circleci

Go library for interacting with [CircleCI's API](https://circleci.com/docs/api).

For the CLI that uses this library, please see
[circle-cli](github.braintreeps.com/jszwedko/circleci-cli).

Currently in alpha, so the library API may change -- please use your favorite
Go dependency management solution. All API endpoints are currently supported.

See `godoc github.braintreeps.com/jszwedko/go-circleci` for API usage.

Feature requests and issues welcome!
